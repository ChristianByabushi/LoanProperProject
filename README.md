## Dataset

 Prosper-Loan dataset contains 113937 entries of loan with113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. 
 Some variables concern the loan and others the borrow.
During our exploratory and axplanatory, we analyse each selected varibales particulally or comparing this with others.

We noticed after our explaratory some isssues of variables, such: null values, order and fixed it where it's necessary lest it affects our researching. 

## Summary of Findings
The purpose of this work were to analyse what kind variables influence loans and borrows.  

When we analyse each variable its self where necessary, that led us tho to question and repond to the questions follows:
-  How much loans are frenquently delivred by borrowers ?
We noticed that the high loan delivred by borrowers are around 10k and 15 k, and 1 k is frequency delivred. 
- How is the frequent payment of loans monthly ? 
The plot shows that, monthly around 500 $ are payed.
- How is statitic of general payment reliazed for each loan status?
By the the survey implemented we notice that, the listing category named to "Debt consolotion" is the most contracter of loans. 

Concerning the bivariate plot the findings that follows have been noticed : 
- How is the the correlation between the loan amount and the borrower interest rate ? 
The plot has shown the loaOriginalAMount increase overtime as soon as  the Borrowerate decreases. The coorelation between both is negative
- Whitch loan amount every listing category has accumulated ?
By looking at this plot we noticed that the loan contracted as debt Consolidation is estimated to 1 billion dollars 

- How is the coorelation between numerical variables inside of the data? 
The heatmap plot has shown that the LoanOriginalAmount is negative, estimated at -0.3. This means as the LoanOrignalAmount increases, the BorrowerRate decreases. 

Finnaly, for multivariate exploration 
- How is the relationship between the loanOriginalAmount and Borrower annually?
The graph generated has shown that for each range of term represented (12, 36, 60), the borrowing rate is negatively correlated with the initial amount of the loan. 
- What is the borrower's loan status rate based on their prosperity rating? 
The plot has shown that the standard deviation of each properRating depends each one during a all terms represented(12,36 and 60 months). Obsiouly the properrating with HR return a higher rate interest.

## Key Insights for Presentation
We wanted to answer a list of questions to which we offered hypothetical answers. by tracing the behavior of variables by univariate, bivariate and multivariate graph.
The results found led us to conclude that borrowers grant a certain loan based on credibility and this often varies by at least 1K. And each time the loan is credible, it pays more.
We have also noticed that certain variables such as the initial amount of the loan when increases, the borrwoerRate decreases.
